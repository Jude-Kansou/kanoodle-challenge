Kanoodle‑style puzzle — what you’re building
Aspect	Summary
Board	Fixed grid, 11 columns × 5 rows (55 squares total).
Pieces	12 polyomino‑like shapes (size 3‑5) with predefined coordinate offsets. Each has a display letter.
Goal	Place all pieces on the board so they cover every square exactly once—no overlaps, no gaps, no out‑of‑bounds.
Core rule	A legal placement is one where every square of a piece is ① inside the grid and ② currently blank.

AI solver — high‑level roadmap
Stage	What to build	Tips
1. Piece orientations	Function that returns every unique rotation / flip for a shape, normalised so (0,0) is always present.	Cache results in the Piece object so you compute them once.
2. Move generator	Given a board state, iterate over (piece × orientation × anchor) triples that are legal (use can_place).	Heuristic: pick the piece with fewest legal moves first to prune faster.
3. Recursive backtracking	Depth‑first search: place a piece, recurse, backtrack.	Keep an ordered list of “remaining pieces”; stop as soon as all are placed.
4. Symmetry pruning (optional)	Skip anchor positions that are rotations/reflections of already‑seen states.	Bitmask representation of the board helps hashing.
5. Solver API	`solve(board) -> List[Placement]	None` (first solution) or generator for all solutions.
6. CLI / tests	python -m sample_solver.solve [-a] writes results.json; pytest ensures at least one solution exists.	Use your new Board.place/remove wrappers internally.
7. Visualizer	Simple matplotlib or Tkinter view to show a found solution.	Map each label to a color for easier inspection.

Starting a fresh “o3” chat
Just open a new conversation and say something like:
“I’m starting a Kanoodle solver project; here’s the board class I already have…”

The model name on this platform is “OpenAI o3,” so you’ll be talking to the same reasoning engine—starting fresh just gives you a clean thread.

Feel free to paste links to the GitHub repo or any code snippets; ask for specific help (e.g. “optimize orientation enumeration” or “design a bitmask board”).

Good luck—your current foundation (Board class with place/remove helpers, immut­able Piece objects, and safety checks) is solid. The next fun milestone is generating orientations and plugging in the recursive search. Happy hacking!
